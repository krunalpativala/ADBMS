ae = edition lock {Edition Lock occurs when a non-editioned object, such as a table or other persistent data structures, interacts with editioned objects (like procedures, packages, or views). Once these objects are linked to an editioned object, they can become edition-locked, meaning that changes to these objects are restricted while they are associated with an edition.}
